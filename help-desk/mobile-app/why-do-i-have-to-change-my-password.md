  have to change your account password when trying out the mobile app for the

# 📝Why Do I have to Change My Password?

**The mobile app is a bit different. Here's why:**

The ShapeShift mobile app is a truly non-custodial wallet experience within an easy to use app. In order to maintain your funds safety, we want to protect your private keys and sign-in credentials from intruders. This means the username and password experience is not like our other platforms. When you create a mobile app account, your username and password are encrypted with your private keys, in a way that makes your wallet only accessible to you. ShapeShift does not have the ability to reset your password. If we did, that would mean we also have access to your wallet - and we don't want that!&#x20;

In the future, we will have wallet back-up solutions, but keep in mind **changing passwords will not be an option**. So please safely store your password. Only your password and the recovery phrase you have access to when logged in can help you regain access to your accounts.&#x20;

Note: If you previously had a ShapeShift account, when you do change your password on the mobile app, you will also lose access to any unclaimed FOX and your transaction history. We recommend before signing into the mobile app, downloading your transaction history first and moving your FOX to your hardware or Portis wallet.
