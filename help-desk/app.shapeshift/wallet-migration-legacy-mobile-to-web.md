**7.** Click "Show Words" to reveal your 12 word recovery sentence. Write these 12 words down and store them securely offline. This 12 word phrase is used to recover your wallet private keys. **Without these 12 words, you are at risk of losing access to your wallet and funds.**

**7a. \_ShapeShift Log In is being Deprecated**\_ - In the near future, we will be sunsetting wallet access via email and password. Rest assured, as long as you have your secret recovery phrase, you will always have access to your wallet. Once your 12 words have been written down/stored offline, click "Next".
