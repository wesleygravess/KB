## DeFi in app.shapeshift

The Overview tab shows your overall net worth, wallet balance, earn balance, and a more detailed view of your staked assets/earnings.

![Image from application](../../.gitbook/assets/overvieww.png)

Here we can see all of the information provided by the Overview section:

![Overview tab summary image](../../.gitbook/assets/overview.png)

Net Worth - The total $ value of your wallet's assets + any balance you have from staking/earning.

![Image of example net worth](../../.gitbook/assets/overview2.png)

Wallet Balance - The total $ value of your wallet's assets (without any staking/earning balances included).

![Image of example of wallet balance](../../.gitbook/assets/overview3.png)

Earn Balance - The total $ value earned so far through staking. Keep in mind that the earn balance has yet to be claimed so is not part of your wallet balance.

![Image of example of earn balance](../../.gitbook/assets/overview4.png)

Earn - Any staked assets along with the current $ value and current APY % will be displayed here.

#### What Is FOXy?

FOXy is a proposed staking rewards system that allows FOX token holders the ability to stake FOX into a smart contract in order to receive rewards denominated in FOXy. **FOXy is an ERC20, rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with FOX tokens**. More information on FOXy can be found [**here**](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/QmQFLXFJGbThVS1fAyXjrcs1HtQtCfenJtPHnJwFBXtn6i).

## FOX Farming - Add to Liquidity Pools and Staking Contract to Earn More FOX

Have you been HODLing FOX or perhaps recently claimed some FOX from our airdrop and would like to accumulate some more? Keep reading to find out how to add FOX to a liquidity pool which will increase your FOX bags!

\
\
**UPDATE:** As of 2/2/22 the newest staking contract (V3) is live! More information can be found [**here**](https://medium.com/@ShapeShift.com/shapeshift-dao-extends-farming-rewards-6f3561d57027).

![v3.png](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article\_attachments/4469878211341/v3.png)

You will need to [**unstake your LP tokens**](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404959328525-Removing-FOX-from-Liquidity-Pool-Unstaking-LP-token-) and add them to the new farming contract in order to continue earning rewards. You do **not** need to remove your liquidity.

**Do I need to claim my farming rewards before February 22?**

When you unstake, you will be claiming your FOX farming rewards at the same time. This means you do not need two different actions for unstaking and claiming your rewards. Your bonus rewards will be deposited into your connected wallet.

In this article we will show you how to stake your FOX and ETH to a FOX/ETH pool on the ShapeShift Mobile App as well as our external [**page**](http://shapeshift.com/shapeshift-decentralize-airdrop).

To remove your staking position, you can reference this [**article**](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404959328525).

## Special Case for XDefi Wallet Users

If you are claiming or staking using XDefi and also have MetaMask extension installed in your browser, please note you will need to make some changes to your XDefi wallet settings to proceed.

Go into the Xdefi wallet settings, turn both injection and ‚Äúas Metamask‚Äù on. Then come back to the [**fox.shapeshift.com/airdrop**](http://fox.shapeshift.com/airdrop) or [**fox.shapeshift.com/fox-farming**](http://fox.shapeshift.com/fox-farming) and select ‚ÄúMetamask‚Äù as their wallet to connect using onboard.js.

Screens on how to enable those Xdefi wallet settings are below:

![](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article\_attachments/4404942407437/Screen\_Shot\_2021-07-12\_at\_2.35.15\_PM.png)

Additionally, if you are unable to connect a wallet because XDefi was connected earlier, clear your cache on your browser and try again.
