# ðŸŽ¬ Can I Use KeepKey with My Mobile Device?

You can use your KeepKey with the MyCelium app. Download MyCelium from the [**Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet\&hl=en\_US) store or the [**App Store**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mycelium-bitcoin-wallet/id943912290?mt=8).&#x20;

Be aware that KeepKey connects to your phone via an OTG adapter cable.&#x20;

If your phone is unable to connect to an OTG adapter cable, you will not be able to use your KeepKey with your mobile device.
