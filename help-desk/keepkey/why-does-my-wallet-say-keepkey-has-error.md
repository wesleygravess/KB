# ⁉ Why Does My Wallet Say "KeepKey Has Error"?

If your wallet says "KeepKey Has Error" in the top right-hand corner, then your KeepKey is not connected. You will need to connect your device in order to make trades.

To **reconnect your KeepKey**, follow these directions:

1. Click on the down arrow where the first two letters of your email are.\

2. You will see a drop-down menu appear and then you will want to click the magnifying glass labeled "Pair KeepKey".\

3. Once you click "Pair KeepKey", you will see a pop-up on your screen at the top left. Click on the device that is found and then click "Connect" at the bottom right of the pop-up.\

4. Your KeepKey will connect and it will show "KeepKey Connected" instead of "KeepKey Has Error" at the top right of the screen.

If your device is still not connected, you will want to disconnect the hardware from the cord and then plug it in again. Once you do that, you will follow the steps above.

Once you have updated the firmware, you will need to completely close out of the KeepKey Updater.&#x20;

KeepKey Updater:
