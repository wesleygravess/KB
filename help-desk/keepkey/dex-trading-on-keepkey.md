**4.** From this trade window you are able to view and adjust the slippage percentage. Since market prices are constantly changing, your trade rate is likely to fluctuate. ShapeShift allows you to set the maximum amount of slippage for any trade you initiate. Click the 3 lines located at the top right hand corner of your trade window.
