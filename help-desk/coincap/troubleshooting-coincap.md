# 🪛 Troubleshooting CoinCap

If the app or website is ever not working as it is supposed to, quitting and reopening should be your first attempt to fix it. If it is still not working, make sure to check your internet connection, browser, etc. Next, please make sure that everything on your phone/computer is working. If the website still will not load it may be down for maintenance or some other technical fix. Please revisit the website in a few hours and see if it is working again. If the application is still not working after all this you may want to delete and reinstall the application. Please note doing this will create a loss of your Altfolios and any other data in the app, so please either write down your holdings or take a screenshot so you may re-input that information. Finally, if none of these work, feel free to open a support ticket to let us know about the issue. We will attempt to resolve the issue as fast as possible and will be in touch when we have any information to share. &#x20;

### **How To Open A Support Ticket:**

&#x20;From the application, you will want to go to the Settings tab, which is located at the bottom right of the app. Under "Links and Docs" you will see an option to “Contact Support”. By clicking this, an email will be generated to our support team. Please let us know what is going wrong so that we may address it.  &#x20;
