# üè¢ Replacing Your Driver Using Zadig

#### Is your Windows machine not detecting your KeepKey, Trezor, or Ledger?

#### We have found that some machines do not have the appropriate default driver settings to successfully recognize a hardware wallet device on beta.shapeshift.com. Not to worry. We have a solution directly from the Windows to help. The following will explain how to use a USB driver installer called Zadig. Installing Zadig

1\. To start, head over to [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) Click "Zadig 2.4" and begin the installation.

Note: If your current Driver is already libusbK (v3.0.7.0), use the up or down arrow(s) to select WinUSB (v6.1.7600.16385).

Zadig should now look something like this:

If you had beta.shapeshift.com open, go ahead and close that down. Restart whichever you were trying to connect your device to and try to pair the KeepKey. If the driver was indeed the issue causing your device to not be detected, you should now see that you are able to connect your KeepKey.
