# 🖥 Log In Issues

## How Do I Log In?

* Go to our website, [https://shapeshift.com/](https://shapeshift.com/), and click "Get Started" or "Launch ShapeShift."
* Click "Connect Wallet."
* Choose your preferred wallet from our list of supported wallets. _Note: at this step you can also click "Demo Wallet," which allows you to see what ShapeShift has to offer without having to connect your personal wallet._&#x20;
* Arrive on the dashboard.



## Why Can't I Log In?

If you cannot log into to our platform, please make sure that you have checked the basics. To start, ask yourself these questions:

* **Am I using the right email address and password?** While it may seem obvious, it can be very easy to mix up your passwords. If you signed up with a personal email but you are using the email you use for work, you will not be able to log in. Be sure to double-check!\

* **Is my window maximized?** Sometimes a smaller window means you can't see the whole page. Be sure you've maximized the window that you are using.\

* **What browser am I using?** ShapeShift is not supported on some browsers. If you are using an old version of your browser, try updating it to the newest version.\

* **Has my browser saved my information incorrectly?** If you are using a browser that continuously stores your login information, make sure it hasn't stored it incorrectly. _Side note: Never let your browser save your credentials! This is a security risk. Instead, use a password manager like_ [_**1Password**_](https://1password.com/)_. We want to keep you safe!_\

* **Did I bookmark the page?** If you have bookmarked the page, make sure you have bookmarked it correctly. Try starting from the homepage by going to ShapeShift.com and navigating to the Membership portal.\

* **Where did I click?** Did you accidentally click "sign up" again? This is a common issue. Assure that you are on the "sign in" page rather than the "sign up" page.\

* **Did I try using an incognito or privacy window?** Open an incognito window in Google Chrome and give it another try.\

* **Did I clear my cache/cookies?** Try [**clearing your cache**](https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahic) **** and see if you are able to log in afterward.\
  &#x20;
* **Are my time and date set correctly in my 2FA app?** If the time or date is incorrect, you will need to do is re-sync it in your Authenticator app. [**This article**](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185834?hl=en) **** can help you.

If you have checked all of these things and you still cannot log in, please [**reach out to our Support Team**.](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
