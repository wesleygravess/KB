### **How Do I Send FIO?**

**1.** Sending FIO is the same as sending any other cryptoasset except you can choose to send to a user's custom FIO address if you have it available.&#x20;

_**Example**_: Instead of sending FIO to an address that looks like:

"FIO56mF5GWfRygBycGS4bAUnQ7bUwoq846vwmooNZw8A5Hn2MY6kH"

&#x20;

You can type in: "user@example" in the address field and send the FIO that way.
