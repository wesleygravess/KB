# ðŸª– How Miner Fees Work on DEXes/DeFi

We currently have 2 DEX aggregators that provide trading for our customers. 0x and THORChain. You can learn more about each of them here:

[**thorchain.org**](http://thorchain.org/)\
[**0x.org**](http://0x.org/)

Currently when using THORChain, the protocol requires you to send 3x the miner fees and you are charged an additional 0.02 RUNE for each trade.

_Additionally, network (miner) fees have been extremely high recently making it impossible to trade smaller amounts (because the fees amount to more than the total being traded)._

Network congestion (meaning a high volume and velocity of trades) has a large impact on fees. This congestion is mostly caused by price fluctuations. Big drops and big spikes means a lot of people are buying and selling. When it comes to DEX trades, since it is working with smart contracts, it is more expensive than centralized trading. A few things to remember:

* Fees are paid to the network, not ShapeShift\*.
* Trading or transacting in small amounts is not a good idea when fees are high.
* You can see average network fees for BTC here: [**https://btc.com/stats/unconfirmed-tx**](https://btc.com/stats/unconfirmed-tx)
* You can see average network fees for ETH here: [**https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum\_average\_transaction\_fee**](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum\_average\_transaction\_fee) (note: sending ETH in a transaction is cheaper than ERC20 sends and DEX trades)

\*Since ShapeShift does not profit on any of these miner fees, we are not offering any reimbursements for the fees paid.
