# üß¢ CoinCap Terminology

CoinCap is happy to be your trusted source of real-time market data. We offer many opportunities to understand cryptocurrency market activity in different ways. To better understand all of the data available, we have explanations of terms used on the site.

**Market Cap -** Short for Market Capitalization, this figure is calculated by multiplying the Price times the Supply. The Market Cap on CoinCap is calculated using the Free-Float Methodology, meaning we use the supply of coins available for trade instead of total supply issued. For more information, see ‚ÄòSupply‚Äô.

**Market Cap= Coin Price\*Available Supply**

**Price -** Price reflects what the current cost of buying one coin is at a specific moment in time. As supply and demand fluctuate, so does the price of the underlying asset. Price on the Coins Page (or homepage) refers to the global average price at which an asset is currently trading. CoinCap calculates this by collecting data from cryptocurrency exchanges and averages those prices based on volume. To better understand how price is calculated, we have included the calculation below:

**Price =   Sum (price\*volume on exchange)**

&#x20;           **‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

&#x20;             **Total volume of asset traded**

**VWAP (24Hr) -** VWAP stands for ‚ÄúVolume Weighted Average Price‚Äù. This calculation is similar to price, but instead assesses all individual trades that have taken place in the last 24 hours.

**Supply -** The Supply of a particular coin is the amount of that coin currently in circulation.  This number may differ from other types of supply such as Total Supply, which is the total amount of coins in existence (these coins may have been created but may not be available for the public to buy/sell), and Max Supply, which is the total amount of coins that will ever be in existence (Coins yet to be mined/created etc.) It is important to note, that only the available supply is used when calculating the market cap.

**Volume (24Hr) -**  This figure captures the volume of trades on the asset in the last 24 hours, represented in the user‚Äôs choice of currencies. The 24 Hour volume not only represents times when the coin was purchased, but also times in which the asset is used to purchase something else.

**Change (24Hr)-** To better understand the most recent trend on price of an asset, the Change (24Hr) statistic offers insight into how the current price compares to the price at this point in time 24 hours ago.

**Flash Price Indicators -** You may see Flash Price indicators as an option in your settings. This option will turn on or off the ability to see the price rapidly change before your eyes as the market moves. The cryptocurrency market changes rapidly and constantly, and we wanted to give you the option to see how crazy it all is. If you choose not to see flash price indicators, your data tables will update every minute to ensure you have the most recent information at your fingertips. &#x20;
