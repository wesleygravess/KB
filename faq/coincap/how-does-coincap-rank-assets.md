# 📙 How Does CoinCap Rank Assets?

CoinCap is your source of information for the cryptocurrency markets. To offer a better understanding of how assets relate to one another, we have determined a ranking system based on three factors - daily trading volume, asset availability, and market cap.

Daily trading volume represents a measure called liquidity - the extent to which the asset can be bought or sold without much risk of moving the price. Assets with high liquidity are easier to buy and sell in the marketplace, therefore we believe daily trading volume must contribute to rank. The second factor - asset availability - relates to how many exchanges trade this asset. Having multiple exchanges offer an asset gives a reference point for price which helps ensure that the data you are seeing is valid. This prevents a single exchange from reporting a price that is not representative for the market. Market Cap is the price times supply of an asset. This metric helps understand the total value is all available assets are purchased.

To better understand rank, we can talk about assets in terms of three tiers - A Tier, B Tier, and C Tier.

The A Tier is our top tier of assets by rank. This tier happens to contain roughly 25% of assets listed on CoinCap. A Tier assets have a daily trading volume of more than $100,000 (USD value) AND are assets that are listed on more than one exchange. After these criteria are met, assets are ranked in order of market cap.

The B Tier is our second tier of assets and also happens to represent roughly 25% of assets listed on CoinCap. These assets may have only one available exchange for trading (in this case, they may have over $100,000 daily volume but only on one exchange). Other assets in this tier have less than $100,000 and more than $10,000 daily trading volume. Assets that meet these criteria are then ranked by market cap.

The C Tier is the last tier of assets and represents all assets with less than $10,000 daily trading volume. Roughly 50% of CoinCap assets fall into this category. Assets with less than $10,000 daily trading volume are then ranked by market cap.

If you are looking to sort assets by something other than rank, try clicking on the column title and CoinCap will sort the list to meet your needs. Care to only look at market cap? Simply go to the table and click the column title “Market Cap” and the list will refresh. The same option is available for Volume (24Hr) in case you just wish to see assets listed by daily trading volume.
