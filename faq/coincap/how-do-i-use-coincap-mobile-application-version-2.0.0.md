# ðŸ“± How Do I Use CoinCap Mobile Application Version 2.0.0?

The long-awaited CoinCap Version 2.0.0 is now available on all Android devices. Before you download and start playing with our new and improved interface, we wanted to share a couple of notes.

#### **Altfolios**

Altfolios have had some vast improvements. You are now able to enter multiple buy/sell events at different prices. You will also find that you can save your Altfolios.

If you are trying to transfer over your Altfolio from your previous app, make sure you have read the following points:

* Your Altfolio will only transfer if you downloaded the 1.5.1 version for iOS or the 1.3.3 version for Android before downloading 2.0. If you had an earlier version and then moved to 2.0, your Altfolio will not carry over.\
  \\
* Altfolio names may not carry over. If this is the case, you just need to rename your Altfolio.\
  \\
* It takes a while for the Altfolio to transfer, so please be patient while getting started in the new application.

#### **Lost Altfolio Data**

If your Altfolio has lost its data, please keep in mind that this data is unrecoverable. We are sorry for any inconvenience.
