# ðŸªŸ What is an HD Wallet?

Some wallets, such as KeepKey or Mycelium, are \*\*\*\* [**HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets**](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic\_wallet). This means that the wallet generates a new address once you use the receive address.&#x20;

However, you can continue to reuse receive addresses as they are still linked to your private key. Cryptoassets that having these changing addresses include (but are not limited to): BTC,BCH, and LTC.

It is important to emphasize that **you can** use any of your previous addresses to receive funds.
