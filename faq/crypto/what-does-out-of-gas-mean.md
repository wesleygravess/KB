# â›½ What Does Out of Gas Mean?

If you run out of gas when exchanging Ethereum, it's similar to running out of gas when driving a car, except imagine that you reached your destination without being able to get _out_ of the car.

Gas is the unit of measure for how much computational work is required to process transactions and smart contracts. Essentially a transaction fee, the term originates from Ethereum, in which context it refers to computation undertaken on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).&#x20;

If you see the message "out of gas", your exchange was successfully completed. However, there was an error sending the ETH to you because the receiving address was an ETH contract address that requires more gas than we attach to a transaction. Some contract addresses are just too expensive.&#x20;
