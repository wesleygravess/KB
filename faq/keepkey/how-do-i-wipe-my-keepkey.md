#### Wiping the KeepKey will set your device back to factory settings. To do so, follow the steps below.

&#x20;

**1.** Have access to your 12 word recovery sentence. If you wipe the device and do not have your recovery sentence, the funds will be permanently lost.

&#x20;

**2.** Download and open the KeepKey Updater App: [**https://beta.shapeshift.com/updater-download#**](https://beta.shapeshift.com/updater-download)

&#x20;     _note:_ If you already have the app downloaded you will need to uninstall and reinstall.

&#x20;

**3.** While the app is open, hold down the button on your KeepKey and plug it in.

&#x20;

**4.** You will see this screen:

&#x20;
