# 📐 What is a KeepKey Label? Why Does it Matter? (On Beta)

Upon plugging in your KeepKey, you will be prompted to enter your PIN. Enter it and click “Submit”.

You will now have the option to create a label for your device. You can name it whatever you’d like. Once you've typed your label of choice, click “Save”.

If you choose to label the KeepKey, you can receive funds without having the device plugged in. The balance will also update without the device being connected. If you choose “No Thanks”, all portfolio data will be erased once you unplug your KeepKey. You will need to connect it again in order to see your balance.

If you would like to remove your saved KeepKey from the platform, you can do so by going to "Settings". Next, click on “Forget” beside the Linked KeepKey you would wish to unpair. Please keep in mind that you can pair multiple KeepKeys to the platform.
