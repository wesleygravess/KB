# ⚙ How to Enable BIP39 Passphrase in the ShapeShift Platform

BIP39 passphrase is now available for the ShapeShift Platform!

**IMPORTANT: Forgetting/losing your passphrase and/or 12-word sentence will result in losing access to your funds. If this happens there is nothing we can do to help.**

First and foremost, make sure your KeepKey is connected to ShapeShift. Click [here](keepkey-set-up.md) for steps on how to get connected.

**NOTE:** Adding a passphrase to your 12-word phrase is essentially like creating a new wallet. You will notice that when you connect the KeepKey and enter your newly added passphrase, zero assets will be in your wallet. If you enter a blank passphrase it will grant access back to your original 12-word-phrase's assets. From there you can send the funds to your new "13-word-phrase".
