# ðŸ§ª DEX Trading On KeepKey

#### Making trades with your KeepKey has never been easier! ShapeShift has integrated with [**0x**](https://0x.org/about/mission) and [**THORChain**](https://docs.thorchain.org/) to offer [**DEX**](../crypto/what-is-a-dex.md) trading to all of our KeepKey users.

#### Which coin pairs are supported?

* Swap BTC, ETH, LTC, SUSHI, and USDT via our THORChain integration
* Swap ETH and 1,000+ ERC-20 tokens via our DEX integration
* All without added commissions or having to supply personal information

Please follow the steps below to complete a successful trade/swap.

**1.** Connect your KeepKey to the [**ShapeShift Platform**](https://beta.shapeshift.com/). Need help getting connected? Follow the guide [**here**](keepkey-set-up.md). Once connected, you will see a green dot next to the name of your KeepKey which indicates the device is successfully connected.

**4.** From this trade window you are able to view and adjust the slippage percentage. Since market prices are constantly changing, your trade rate is likely to fluctuate. ShapeShift allows you to set the maximum amount of slippage for any trade you initiate. Click the 3 lines located at the top right hand corner of your trade window.
