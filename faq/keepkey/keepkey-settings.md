3. Confirm that you want to wipe the device by clicking the checkbox. If you are confident that you want to wipe the device, click "Wipe Device".
4. Your KeepKey will now be back to the default settings. You will need to initialize the device to create a new wallet or recover the KeepKey using the recovery sentence to restore your wallet and access your funds.
