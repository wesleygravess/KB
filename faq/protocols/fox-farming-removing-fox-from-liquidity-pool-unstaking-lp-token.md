1. Once you have your LP tokens staked, you can unstake them at any time. From [http://fox.shapeshift.com/fox-farming](http://fox.shapeshift.com/fox-farming) you can view any Pool or Staking details that you are a part of.![Screen\_Shot\_2021-07-12\_at\_3.22.53\_PM.png](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article\_attachments/4404950972685/Screen\_Shot\_2021-07-12\_at\_3.22.53\_PM.png)

3. Keep in mind that you will need to make confirmations on your wallet throughout this process. This will require you to pay attention to any pop-up messages from the wallet you are using (ie: Portis, MetaMask, etc) or the wallet itself if you are using a hardware wallet (KeepKey, Ledger, Trezor). This includes approving tokens and paying the gas fee (in ETH). Make sure you have a sufficient amount of ETH in your wallet before removing any liquidity and/or unstaking.
4. Once unstaked, you will now see the LP token balance has moved from “Staked Balance” To “Available to Stake”![Screen\_Shot\_2021-07-12\_at\_3.24.02\_PM.png](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article\_attachments/4404950999565/Screen\_Shot\_2021-07-12\_at\_3.24.02\_PM.png)
