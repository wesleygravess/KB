# ðŸ’° DeFi Section - Overview

The Overview section shows your overall net worth, wallet balance, earn balance, and a more detailed view of your staked assets/earnings. You can deposit, withdraw, and claim rewards from your positions from this page as well.&#x20;

Net Worth - The total $ value of your wallet's assets + any balance you have from staking/earning.

Wallet Balance - The total $ value of your wallet's assets (without any staking/earning balances included).

Earn Balance - The total $ value earned so far through staking. Keep in mind that the earn balance has yet to be claimed so is not part of your wallet balance.

Earn - Any staked assets along with the current $ value and current APY % will be displayed here.
