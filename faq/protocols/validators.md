### What is a Validator?

A [validator ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/validator)is a crucial part of the [Proof of Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) ([POS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism whose responsibility is to verify blocks to earn rewards. The decentralized nature of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology makes it impressive and so promising that more and more people are adopting it. Every blockchain has building blocks that are called [nodes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/node). They are responsible for holding data but this data needs to be first validated or verified on the blockchain network. Thatâ€™s where a validator comes into play. There are two common validation protocols of a blockchain network, which are [Proof-of-Work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow) and Proof-of-Stake.

Much like a banker who is responsible for verifying a transaction before its processing, a validator verifies each incoming transaction.&#x20;

A transaction can only be completed and its record can be added to the blockchain once its accuracy and legal authenticity are checkedâ€”thatâ€™s done by a validator.

In the Proof-of-Stake mechanism, a validator determines whether or not a transaction conforms to the rules that deem it as valid. The entire process makes a blockchain network secure and transparent.&#x20;
