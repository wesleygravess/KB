# ðŸŒ€ 0x

0x is an open-source, decentralized exchange infrastructure that enables the exchange of tokenized assets on multiple blockchains.\
\
The 0x protocol is, at its core, a set of secure smart contracts that facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)-based assets. The protocol serves as an open standard and common building block for any developer needing exchange functionality. \
\
In addition to the externally-audited smart contracts, 0x also offers developer tools tailored to the ecosystem and open-access to a pool of shared liquidity.

Developers can integrate with 0x at the smart contract or application layer.\
\
The diagram below shows an overview of the 0x ecosystem, which includes applications who provide liquidity (supply), applications who consume liquidity (demand), and the multiple supported blockchains. \
