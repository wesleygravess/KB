_What do you need? WETH and FOX on the Polygon Network._

### **How Do I Add ETH and FOX To The Polygon Network?**

For this example we will be using [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/). You can also use [**WalletConnect**](https://walletconnect.org/) or [**CoinBase Wallet**](https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm\_source=google\_search\_b\&utm\_medium=cpc\&utm\_campaign=1658290208\&utm\_content=62639313526\&utm\_term=coinbase%20wallet\&utm\_creative=543006700251\&cb\_device=c\&cb\_placement=\&cb\_country=us\&cb\_city=open\&cb\_language=en\_us\&gclid=Cj0KCQjwv5uKBhD6ARIsAGv9a-yWzP9T1EOiEKj7As0SxaEVWejUiiMBINeNbuz0ILeN2SPq34w0qMAaAvEWEALw\_wcB) as well.

&#x20;

**1.** Head to [**https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge** ](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge)and connect your MetaMask wallet. Once connected you will see "Account xx1234" in the top right hand side of the page.
