# â›“ Blockchains

A [blockchain ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.

Currently ShapeShift supports 10 different chains.&#x20;

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum - you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

### Bitcoin

[Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp) is a [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp), a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, and thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.
