# ðŸ’µ How Do I Set the Default Currency?

CoinCap offers over 150 currencies to choose from! To change currencies, just look to the bottom right of any page to find the "Base Currency" drop-down. You can either scroll through currency options or you can type in the currency symbol, such as EUR for Euros. Youâ€™ll find more than fiat currencies, though. CoinCap offers value translations in a number of cryptocurrencies as well. This is especially helpful for those who may trade by using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.
