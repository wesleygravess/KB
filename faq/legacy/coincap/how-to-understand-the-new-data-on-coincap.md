# 💿 How to Understand the New Data on CoinCap

CoinCap offers more easy ways to understand the markets.

* Click on an asset to see more details such as asset history chart and where that asset is traded. When you click on an asset such as Bitcoin then scroll down past the charts, you’ll find listed markets. These are the markets in which you can buy or sell Bitcoin.
* The “Exchanges” tab at the top of the page brings you to a list of all the exchanges which contribute data to CoinCap. See all the coin pairs offered by that exchange and get insight into the volume traded on that pair. At the top of each exchange page, you’ll find the “Website” button which will make it easy to explore an exchange further.
* TradingView is a useful way to see data in advanced charts! This charting library is common, perhaps you’ve seen some TradingView charts in the past. The new CoinCap site offers our market history in these advanced charts!
