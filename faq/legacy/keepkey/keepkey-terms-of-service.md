&#x20;

The Service is provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis. Use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from KeepKey or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.

&#x20;

Federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

&#x20;

&#x20;

1. Limitation of Liability

&#x20;

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall KeepKey, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this service. Under no circumstances will KeepKey be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or your account or the information contained therein.

&#x20;

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, KeepKey assumes no liability or responsibility for any (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; (c) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (d) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; (e) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; (f) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or (g) User Content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. In no event shall KeepKey, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to KeepKey hereunder or one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100.00), whichever is greater.

&#x20;

This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if KeepKey has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.

&#x20;

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

&#x20;

1. Governing Law, Arbitration

&#x20;

1. **Governing Law.** These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles, except to the extent Delaware state law is preempted by federal law. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the applicable rules of arbitration in the State of Delaware. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that the State of Delaware is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

&#x20;

1. **Arbitration.** Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from KeepKey. For any dispute with KeepKey, you agree to first contact us at [https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us](https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that KeepKey has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, ‚ÄúClaims‚Äù), by binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable rules of arbitration in the State of Delaware. The arbitration will be conducted in Delaware, in English, unless you and KeepKey agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any arbitration fees, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with applicable arbitration rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) the arbitration organization may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from such arbitration organization; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing KeepKey from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.

&#x20;

1. General

&#x20;

1. **Assignment.** These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by KeepKey without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

&#x20;

1. **Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms.** KeepKey may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by KeepKey in our sole discretion. KeepKey reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. KeepKey is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. KeepKey may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‚Äòlast modified‚Äô date at the bottom of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

&#x20;

1. **Entire Agreement/Severability.** These Terms, together with any additional terms, amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with KeepKey in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and KeepKey concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

&#x20;

1. **No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and KeepKey‚Äôs failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

&#x20;

1. **Contact.** Please contact us by submitting a request to us at [https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with any questions regarding these Terms.
