## How Quickly Can You Process My Order?

Processing orders can take some time, depending on network congestion.

The processing speed ranges from approximately thirty seconds to a few hours, depending on how long it takes for a block to happen on the network. On occasion, it can take as long as forty-eight hours to confirm.

Keep in mind that most orders process in just a few minutes. For some inputs, we will take zero-confirmation transactions. This is only if the transaction passes a number of zero-confirm "tests" that our system looks for. If it doesn't pass those tests, then the system will wait for standard confirmation on the blockchain.



## Why was the Miner Fee Deducted from My Refund or Withdrawal?

ShapeShift uses a flat-rate miner fee for every transaction we facilitate, regardless of the size of the transaction. This relatively high miner fee ensures that our users are able to receive their funds as quickly as possible without experiencing delays due to network congestion.\
\
In the event that your deposit is returned to you, you will notice that a miner fee is deducted from your original deposit amount. This is the miner fee required for us to send your crypto back to you in a timely manner.\
\
This can disproportionately impact smaller value transactions.\
