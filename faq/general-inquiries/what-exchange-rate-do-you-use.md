# ðŸ’» What Exchange Rate Do You Use?

The exchange rate is our own, derived from several market sources and based on the amount we feel comfortable exchanging at that fixed rate (whether you do small or large order, the rate stays the same - no slippage).&#x20;

We earn a profit to the extent we can source coins in other markets for a lower cost to replenish our reserves.
