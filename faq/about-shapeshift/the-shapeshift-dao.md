# The ShapeShift DAO

### The Seeds

The former ShapeShiftAG organization made the first official documented transition from an existing traditional corporate organization to a DAO. To assist in these efforts one of the largest airdrops up to this point in crypto was rolled out over 1 million plus addresses, and a structured process of dissolving the existing corporate structure began. With the official documented start date of July 14, 2021 ShapeShift set out to attempt something new and innovative in the business world.

### ShapeShift DAO Terminology

#### **DAO -** Decentralized Autonomous Organization

Learn about our DAO's specific structure [**here**](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/shapeshift-organizational-structure/50).

#### **FOX:**

&#x20;This is ShapeShift's governance token. It is an ERC20 token. ERC20 tokens are a second layer protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. All ERC20 tokens require ETH to send them across the Ethereum blockchain.

#### **FOX Liquidity Providing:**&#x20;

This is when you provide equal amounts of FOX and ETH to the UniSwap v2 FOX-ETH Liquidity pool. This gives that liquidity pool depth and lowers the [**price impact**](broken-reference) of swaps.

#### **FOX-ETH LP Tokens:**&#x20;

When you provide liquidity, UniSwap sends you back a FOX-ETH LP tokens. Think of these as a coat check ticket that you give back to UniSwap when you want to remove your liquidity.

**FOX Staking** - This is when you send your FOX-ETH LP Tokens to the FOX Staking Contract so you can earn additional FOX Token rewards.

**FOX Farming** - After you stake your FOX-ETH LP Tokens in the FOX Staking Contract, the FOX Token Rewards you earn is also know as Farming or Yield Farming.
