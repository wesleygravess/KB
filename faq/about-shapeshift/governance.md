A graphic description of different stepsNow that ShapeShift is becoming a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) you may be wondering how decisions are going to be made and prioritized. This is going to be done through a decentralized governance model. Along with the many other benefits of holding FOX ([**http://shapeshift.com/fox/benefits**](http://shapeshift.com/fox/benefits)) FOX now represents voting power for the DAO. Every FOX token gets one vote for any proposal that is being decided on. Now every FOX holder can help shape the future of ShapeShift!
