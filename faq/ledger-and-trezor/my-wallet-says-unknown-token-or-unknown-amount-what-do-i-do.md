# ðŸ‘€ My Wallet Says "Unknown Token" or "Unknown Amount" - What Do I Do?

Trezor and Ledger may not recognize your FOX tokens, because they are not supported by the wallet. But do not worry! Your tokens are safely stored there. You can search the address your FOX tokens are stored on at [etherscan.io](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/etherscan.io) to ensure they are stored at that address.

Only you - or the person who has access to your private keys - has access to any of your assets on your wallet.
