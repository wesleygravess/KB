## Viewing Your Balance

**1.** Navigate to your **Dashboard** through the menu at the bottom of the app screen. From here you can see which assets are currently stored in your wallet. You can also see your overall portfolio balance and how much you've gained/loss. Your gains/losses can be viewed five different ways: Hour, Day, Week, Month, and Year. If at anytime you'd like to change the currency, tap USD (the default currency for our app) and select your preferred currency.
